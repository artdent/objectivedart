A simple fretboard trainer.

This app asks you to play random notes on random strings at a timed interval.
It is a trivial web app that just barely meets my own needs.
If you want something fancier, [this Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redrabbit.android.guitar.guitarfretboardtrainerlite&hl=en)
looks interesting.

The name has threefold meaning: it sounds like "objet d'art"; the objective
of using it is to learn the art of playing guitar; and the program
is written in Dart. Any relation to other things beginning with
"Objective" is pure trolling^Wcoincidence.
